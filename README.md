Personal scripts that I use to set up an Ubuntu 22.04 laptop

## Terminal

```LHRClone.sh``` is a script to clone all the repositories and software I need for LHR

## Dev

## WSL
```WSL.sh``` is for installing tools and dependencies for WSL.   
For USB support you need to download the [USBIPD-WIN project](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases) while in Windows. The rest are steps in Linux that are handled by this script
